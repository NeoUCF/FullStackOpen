"All of the logic is on the server, and the browser only renders the HTML as instructed."

Requests being made on load of web page:

"Document Object Model, or DOM, is an Application Programming Interface (API) that enables programmatic modification of the element trees corresponding to web pages."

Back then, it was common to have the `action` and `method` attribute with the `form` tag. On submit of form, the web page would reload and re-request the same resources as before.

"AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a term introduced in February 2005 on the back of advancements in browser technology to describe a new revolutionary approach that enabled the fetching of content to web pages using JavaScript included within the HTML, without the need to rerender the page."


# Single-Page Applications (SPAs)

"SPA-style websites don't fetch all of their pages separately from the server... [it] comprise only one HTML page fetched from the server, the contents of which are manipulated with JavaScript that executes in the browser."

# Quick History of Popular JS Libraries

JQuery -> Backbone.js -> AngularJS (v1; 2012) -> Angular (v2; 2014) -> React + Redux -> Vue.js -> Svelete.js


# Full-stack Web Development

"Practically all web applications have (at least) two "layers": the browser, being closer to the end-user, is the top layer, and the server the bottom one."
"...think of the architecture of a web application as a stack of layers."

Full-stack development means development on all parts of an application: frontend, backend, and database (cloud sometimes)

Node.js was created as a runtime for backend to develop with JavaScript. Before Node.js, JavaScript was only available on browsers.
